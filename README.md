# global-entry-notifier
A simple python script that notifies the user when an appropriate Global Entry appointment slot opens up.

The script contains some sections that the user has to configure themselves. For location IDs, find your desired location IDs [here](https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov/schedulerapi/locations/?temporary=false&inviteOnly=false&operational=true&serviceName=Global%20Entry) and input them into the list in the same style as the examples already in the list.

## Usage 

Simply clone the repo, configure the code based on the commented instructions, then run the python file. You will need to download and install python3 to run the script.
